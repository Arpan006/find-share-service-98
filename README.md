## Project Overview
FindIt is a community-driven platform for VIT Bhopal hostel students, solving:
- **Lost & Found**: Report and recover lost items in hostel areas (e.g., dining halls) using AI-driven matching.
- **Second-hand Exchange**: Share or donate unused items (e.g., textbooks) within the hostel, earning green points for sustainability.
- **Local Services**: Book verified hostel maintenance staff (e.g., plumbers) for quick repairs, with a review system.

The app operates in the problem domain of improving the hostel living experience through efficient management of lost items, resource sharing, and maintenance services. It was developed as part of the SolVIT Hackathon organized by the Hostel Committee at VIT Bhopal University.
